# Code of Conduct templates for research laboratories

## Welcome to this repository!!!

### What is this project about?
The goal of this project is to encourage research laboratories to implement their Code of Conducts and share them with lab members. 

### Why is this necessary? Isn't common sense enough?
Common sense is enough until it isn't. Common sense might mean different things to different individuals coming from different cultural and upbringing backgrounds. We believe code of conducts are not only good for establishing productive collaborations between lab members and helping build trust between mentor and mentees, but are also necessary in their attempt to clarify any confusion about what behavior is tolerated and what it is not.

### How will we succeed?
We are committed to working together to create templates that can be easily adapted by principal investigators, research lab managers, and program directors to best fit their needs and institutions. However, we need your help to make these templates as thorough as possible. 
Furthermore we would like to collect inforamation, even anectodal, about times you were in a situation in which a code of conduct would have helped you better menage the problem. 

### How can you contribute?
We are at the very beginning of this project, so we have not yet shared any content to which you could contribute directly on this repository (but stay tuned because we will have something very soon). But if you would like to help us build this project from the ground up, let us know by making an issue or email us at daniela.saderi@gmail.com. If you know of someone who has already worked or is currently working on a similar effort, also please let us know. Thank you!

### Who are 'We'?
We are Daniela Saderi, Ph.D. student, and Glynis Mattheisen, Ph.D., in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at Oregon Health & Science University, Portland Oregon (USA).
