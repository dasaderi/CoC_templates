# Code of Conduct templates for research laboratories

## Welcome to this repository!!!

### What is this project about?
The goal of this project is to encourage research laboratories
to implement their Codes of Conduct and share them with lab members.

### Why is this necessary? Isn't common sense enough?
Common sense is enough until it isn't.
Common sense might mean different things to different individuals
coming from different cultural and upbringing backgrounds.
We believe codes of conduct
are not only good for establishing productive collaborations between lab members
and helping build trust between mentor and mentees,
but are also necessary
in their attempt to clarify any confusion about what behavior is tolerated
and what is not.

### How will we succeed?
We are committed to working together to create templates
that can be easily adapted by
principal investigators, research lab managers, and program directors
to best fit their needs and institutions.
However, we need your help to make these templates as thorough as possible.
Furthermore, we would like to collect inforamation,
even anectodal, about times you were in a situation
in which a code of conduct would have helped you better manage the problem.

### How can you contribute?
We are at the very beginning of this project,
so we have not yet shared any content to which you could contribute directly on this repository
(but stay tuned because we will have something very soon).
But if you would like to help us build this project from the ground up,
let us know by making an issue or email us at daniela.saderi@gmail.com.
If you know of someone who has already worked
or is currently working on a similar effort,
also please let us know.
Thank you!


## MOZFEST 2018
This project will be updated with input from attendees of
[**MozFest**](https://mozillafestival.org/)
[session](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/mozfest-program-2018/issues/575#issuecomment-430313032)
Daniela will be laeding on Oct 28th at 3:15 PM.

Here is the abstact for the session
designed by Daniela Saderi and Robin Champieux,
but led at MozFest by Daniela and Julia Lawndes:
"Common sense is enough until it isn't.
A Code of Conduct outlines expectations for community members,
and sometimes that community is an academic lab.
CoCs are not only good for establishing productive collaborations between lab members
and helping build trust between mentor and mentees.
A good one will welcome new members,
inspire the team,
and make clear the kinds of behavior that won't be tolerated.
Ultimately,
a good CoC is a tool for fostering
a safe, transparent, inclusive, and successful lab.
Here, we will discuss why CoCs should be mandatory in academic laboratories
and ask participants to contribute to the design of open CoC templates
that can be adopted and adapted by research laboratories.
We will follow a design thinking approach
and invite the group to share experiences around
and contribute to different aspects of a Lab CoC.
The output of this session will be shared on our GitHub repository."

are the slides we used for the session at MozFest.
We used a design thinking approach
heavily inspired by the work of Lorraine Chuen and Joe McArthur
during OpenCon 2017 do-a-thon in Berlin
(full deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jVSrReb2gI65sZ68LGf5APcnLVJ38IoiHOQ4qvXkCoE/edit?usp=sharing)).
