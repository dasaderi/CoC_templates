# Code of Conduct templates for research laboratories

## Welcome to this repository!!!

### What is this project about?
The goal of this project is to encourage research laboratories to implement their Code of Conducts and share them with lab members. 

### Why is this necessary? Isn't common sense enough?
Common sense is enough until it isn't. Common sense might mean different things to different individuals coming from different cultural and upbringing backgrounds. We believe code of conducts are not only good for establishing productive collaborations between lab members and helping build trust between mentor and mentees, but are also necessary in their attempt to clarify any confusion about what behavior is tolerated and what it is not.

### How will we succeed?
We are committed to working together to create templates that can be easily adapted by principal investigators, research lab managers, and program directors to best fit their needs and institutions. However, we need your help to make these templates as thorough as possible. 
Furthermore we would like to collect inforamation, even anectodal, about times you were in a situation in which a code of conduct would have helped you better menage the problem. 

### How can you contribute?
We are at the very beginning of this project, so we have not yet shared any content to which you could contribute directly on this repository (but stay tuned because we will have something very soon). But if you would like to help us build this project from the ground up, let us know by making an issue or email us at daniela.saderi@gmail.com. If you know of someone who has already worked or is currently working on a similar effort, also please let us know. Thank you!


## MOZFEST 2018
This project will be updated with input from attendees of [**MozFest**](https://mozillafestival.org/) [session](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/mozfest-program-2018/issues/575#issuecomment-430313032) Daniela will be laeding on Oct 28th at 3:15 PM.

Here is the abstact for the session that will be led by Daniela Saderi and Robin Champieux:
"Common sense is enough until it isn't. A Code of Conduct outlines expectations for community members, and sometimes that community is an academic lab. CoCs are not only good for establishing productive collaborations between lab members and helping build trust between mentor and mentees. A good one will welcome new members, inspire the team, and make clear the kinds of behavior that won't be tolerated. Ultimately, a good CoC is a tool for fostering a safe, transparent, inclusive, and successful lab. Here, we will discuss why CoCs should be mandatory in academic laboratories and ask participants to contribute to the design of open CoC templates that can be adopted and adapted by research laboratories. We will follow a design thinking approach and invite the group to share experiences around and contribute to different aspects of a Lab CoC. The output of this session will be shared on our GitHub repository."
