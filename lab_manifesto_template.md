# Lab Manifesto Template 
(1st draft and work in progress)

#### The following document has been adapted from the Freeman Lab Manifesto, the Klassen Lab Mentoring Expectations for Graduate Students, and the [Kirstie Withaker Lab Code of Conduct](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

This document is primarily aimed at graduate students pursuing a PhD or masters degree. If you are a staff member, 
undergraduate, postdoc, or are joining the lab in some other capacity, let me know if you have questions about how this 
document applies to you.

### Purpose
This document should be viewed as a tool to initiate discussion during the early stages of the graduate program, with an 
awareness that the relationship and expectations will evolve with time. The parties may wish to use this template not only 
for verbal discussion but also as a written letter of understanding that will help to guide the relationship and expectations 
of the student, their PI, and the relevant departments/faculties. The hope is that this agreement clarifies questions that 
arise in the lab setting and reduces conflict or tension to make everyone’s interactions more enjoyable.  

### Responsibilities

#### As a graduate student, it is your responsibility to:
* Complete your degree. This includes classroom and laboratory work, which must be conducted at all times with professionalism, 
self-motivation, engagement, scientific curiousity, and high ethical standards.
* Be knowledgeable of the policies, deadlines, and requirements of the graduate program, the graduate school, and the university. 
Comply with all institutional policies, including academic program milestones, laboratory practices, and rules related to 
chemical safety, biosafety, and fieldwork.  
* Work with me to develop a thesis project for your degree. Your degree requires that you produce a coherent body of research 
representing a contribution to your scientific field. Ensure that your research is ultimately proceeding towards this goal.
* Be responsive to advice and constructive criticism. The feedback you get from me, your colleagues, your committee members, 
and your course instructors is intended to improve you. Respect the wisdom of those who have gone before you. 
Provide feedback on my mentoring to you. Not everyone has the same mentoring needs and personalities, so there will inevitably 
be places where my efforts do not line up with your preferences. I am not infallible, but can only make adjustments when I know 
that they are needed. 

#### As a PI, it is my responsibility to:

* Provide everyone under my supervision an environment that is intellectually stimulating, emotionally supportive, safe, 
and free of harassment. I will enforce a culture governed by collegiality that values differences in personalities and opinions 
(see below for the detailed version of the lab harassment-free policy).
* Be committed to your research project. I will help you design an independent project within the scope of my lab's research 
for your thesis. I will be intellectually committed to your research. This includes helping you to generate experimental and 
theoretical ideas, interpreting and constructively criticizing your data and contextualizing it within a broader context, and 
supporting you in presenting your ideas and results to the scientific community. 
* Ensure that you receive training. I will provide resources and mentorship from both myself and senior lab members so that you 
have the technical skills that you need to accomplish your research.  If the training you need does not fall within the lab’s 
expertise, we shall discuss opportunities for you to receive that training elsewhere, either through collaborations with other 
laboratories or by attending workshops and classes outside of this University.
* Lead by example and facilitate your training in complementary skills needed to be a successful scientist, such as oral and 
written communication, applying for grants, lab management, mentoring, and scientific ethics and professionalism. I will 
encourage you to seek teaching opportunities, even if not required for your degree, include you where appropriate in grant 
writing and manuscript reviews, and provide opportunities for you to mentor junior researchers. I will enforce high standards 
of scientific ethics and professionalism.  
* Provide financial resources to you as appropriate and/or according to my institution's guidelines. To the best of my ability, 
I will provide the resources that you need to conduct your experiments. In addition, I will support you in trying to obtain 
external funding for your degree program.
* Help you navigate your graduate program of study. You are responsible for keeping up with deadlines and being knowledgeable 
about requirements for your specific program. However, I am available to help interpret these requirements, select appropriate 
coursework, and select committee members for your oral exams. 
* Help you build your professional social networks, including presenting at scientific meetings. I will attempt, as funding 
allows, to send you to a major conference every year when you have material to present. I will also help you to identify and 
apply for travel fellowships to help pay for attending these conferences
* Provide career advice and assist you in finding a position following your graduation. I will give advice and feedback on your 
career goals, and encourage you to explore opportunities both outside and within academia as suits your interests and progress. 
I will promptly provide honest letters of recommendation whenever they are requested of me

### The XX Lab is committed to an harassment-free policy
We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every member has an enjoyable and fulfilling 
learning and working experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any XX Lab project is expected to show respect and 
courtesy to other members at all time.
To make clear what is expected, I ask all members of the XX lab to conform to the following Code of Conduct:
_PI NAME_, as head of the XX Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless 
of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, national origin, age or 
religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.

**In summary:**  
* All communication – online and in person – should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 
* Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
* Be kind to others. 
* Do not insult or put down other lab members.  
* Behave professionally. 
* Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.  

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Members of the XX lab who violate these rules – no matter how much they have contributed to the XX lab, or how specialised 
their skill set – will be approached by _PI NAME_. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with _PI NAME_, 
the perpetuator will be asked to discontinue their participation in XX lab projects.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
For students with disabilities or specific medical needs, we will meet to discuss what accommodations should to be made to 
your work schedule or lab responsibilities to facilitate your productivity in the lab without compromising on your physical or mental health. If changes in your needs occur over time, we will meet again to revise this accommodation. I promise to prioritize your health for the good of the lab community.

### Lab meetings
Lab meetings will occur weekly. Attendance is required and it is imperative that you come prepared.  I will notify you of changes to the schedule at least a day in advance. In addition, I will meet individually with graduate students on a weekly basis to discuss progress on top of weekly lab meetings. The timing of these meetings may change depending on projects, pending publications, and your graduate defense. We will address this as needed.

### Lab Documents
It is your responsibility to maintain a detailed, organized, and accurate record of your research. Lab notebooks are lab 
property and therefore must be maintained to a standard where they can be interpreted by others. Any computer code that you 
generate must be properly documented and reproducible. Expect that all of your code will be published alongside manuscripts. 
All raw data, metadata, analyzed data, manuscripts, figures, and coding developed in the lab are required to be available on a 
shared drive and/or cloud. 

### Presentations
You will begin presenting your work in department seminars and external meetings as soon as you begin generating data. You will 
engage fully in the scientific program of the conferences that you attend. These do not count as vacations or deduct from your 
time off. You should aim to present at program and departmental seminars 2-3 times per year in addition to attending one 
scientific conference per year. 

### Manuscripts
Depending on your experience and level of comfort with writing a scientific manuscript, my level of engagement related to 
writing it will change. It is often than case that the first first manuscript is  written largely by the PI and/or by any other 
more senior author (e.g., a postdoc) who had contributed to the study, with lots of input from you, the trainee and first author 
of the manuscript.  You will, for instance, be asked to make figures, help outline the flow, and edit the text. However, I 
expect you to be largely responsible for the writing of a second manuscript. 
Authorship is based on intellectual contributions to the content of the manuscript and not granted to those providing animal 
models, reagents, or other resources. We will have a specific meeting to discuss authorship before preparing any and all 
manuscripts. Any changes to this agreement will be promptly communicated and discussed with you.

### Time Off
Graduate school is a commitment greater than an average job; working beyond a typical 40-hour work week is not unusual. I expect 
you to be productive in your research and the other elements of your graduate program (teaching etc.). How you achieve this is 
ultimately up to you and should be customized to fit your working style. If you or I feel like you are not progressing adequately, 
you or I should discuss the situation and work together to find a more suitable and productive working schedule. 
Vacations and work-life balance are important for creative thinking and good health. However, please consult with me before 
making plans, and understand that some activities are time-sensitive (e.g., sampling, preparing for grants, manuscripts, exams, 
or conferences). You should not plan for more than 2 weeks of personal vacation time per year, not inclusive of national 
holidays. Jury duty doesn't count towards your vacation time. I am also certainly willing to accommodate sick and/or parental 
leave as required, and will determined this on a case-by-case basis. 
Before I take a vacation, I will provide the lab with at least one week notice so that we can all work around my absence without 
loss of productivity. When I am on vacation, I prefer to be contacted via email in the case of lab-based emergencies.

### Career Development
It is your responsibility as a graduate student to actively cultivate your professional development in non-research contexts. Becoming a successful scientist requires more than just academic research. You are expected to continually develop as a teacher, as a scientific ambassador to the general public, and your scientific network. This may include taking advantage of professional programs offered through the university, active participation in external seminars, attending classes without direct applications to your research, conferences, workshops, and membership in professional societies. 
If your participation in a career-building course, program, or event requires you to reduce your time spent by lab we will discuss it on a case-by-case basis. 

## What is success?
